<h2 class="h2" style="text-align:center;">Overview</h2>
  <p class="cardcaption" style="text-align:center;">Holodomor refers to the starvation of millions of Ukrainians in 1932–33 as a result of Soviet policies.<br> It was the culmination of an assault by the Communist Party and Soviet state on the Ukrainian peasantry, who<br> resisted Soviet policies. This assault occurred in the context of a campaign of intimidation and arrests of Ukrainian<br> intellectuals, writers, artists, religious leaders, and political cadres, who were seen as a threat to Soviet ideological<br> and state-building aspirations.</p>

        <h1>Why?</h1>
	      <p class="p5">
	  It was all an attempt to force Ukraine into Soviet governance. On the seventh anniversary<br> of Holodomor, the United Nations issued a statement
	  honouring the lives lost under Stalin's tyranny.<br> Today we have learned that committing acts of genocide has no place in our society.
