<h2 class="h2" style="text-align:center;">Faces of Auschwitz</h2>
  <p class="cardcaption" style="text-align:center;" >Established by Nazi Germany’s SS (Schutzstaffel) authorities in occupied Poland during the spring of 1940,<br> KL Auschwitz originally served as a concentration camp for Polish prisoners. After the first two years of its operation,<br> it became the most deadly Nazi extermination camp. It is estimated that 1,1 million people perished in Auschwitz-Birkenau<br> between 1940-1945. Prisoner faces and heads were shaven and their uniforms embroidered with camp numbers, <br>triangles corresponding to different prisoner categories, and letters identifying prisoners’ countries of origin. </p>

        <h1>"<i>Deutschlands</i> Kampf"</h1> <p class="p6">Adolf Hitler was the undisputed leader of the National Socialist German Workers Party—known as Nazis—since 1921.<br> Hitler’s ideological goals included territorial expansion, consolidation of a racially pure state, and elimination of the<br> European Jews and other perceived enemies of Germany. Hitler’s virulent anti-Semitism and obsessive pursuit of Aryan<br>supremacy fueled the murder of some 6 million Jews, along with other victims of the Holocaust</p>

  <p>The relationship between history, film and memory is an important one. Depicting the Holocaust<br> in film can be considered as a way to pay tribute to the people who died in one of the most horrific tragedies<br> in human history while also encouraging society to dig deeper into its causes and effects.

  <p class="p5">The Holocaust illustrates the dangers of prejudice, discrimination, antisemitism<br> and dehumanization. It also reveals the full range of human responses - raising<br> important considerations about societal and individual motivations and pressures<br> that lead people to act as they do - or to not act at all.</p>
