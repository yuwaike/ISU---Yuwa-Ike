<p class="p2">During WW2, Japan committed
horrible war crimes<br>against China
and other surrounding<br> Asian
countries. </p>

<h2 class="h2" style="text-align:center;">What happened?</h2>
  <p class="p3" style="text-align:center;">The Japanese military is
responsible for using biological
warfare, enslaving women into sex work, experimenting<br>on live
prisoners of war, and the Nanking
massacre that killed hundreds of
thousands of unarmed Chinese
soldiers. <br>In 1945, atomic bombs
were dropped on Nagasaki and
Hiroshima by the United States
with support from Canada and<br>
Britain.</p>

        <h1>Nagasaki and Hiroshima</h1> <p class="p6">In 1945, atomic bombs
were dropped on Nagasaki and
Hiroshima by the United States
with<br>support from Canada and
Britain. For some, it felt like the right move, but the US government
faced backlash<br> for dropping the
bomb on heavily populated areas
with critiques claiming that it was a war crime.<br> The issues commonly brought up by the debate is whether or not Japan <i>deserved</i> it. There are several<br> things that can be brought to question in regards to the Japanese government and army at this time.<br> For starters the Nanjing Massacre; the mass killings of Chinese citizens by the Japanese army in 1937,<br> the treatment of allied POWs; where they were beaten, starved, and abused, and the expiriments taken<br> place in unit 731; where researchers tested biological warfare on prisoners. </p>

        <h1>Comfort Women (いあんふ)</h1>
  <p class="p5">The term comfort women was euphemism for women who provided sexual services to Japanese<br> Imperial Army troops during Japan's militaristic period that ended with World War II. They generally<br> lived under conditions of sexual slavery and it is recognized as the largest case of government-sponsored<br> human trafficking and sexual slavery in modern history. Under the 2015 comfort women agreement,<br> Japan paid 1 billion yen to the comfort women victims. Unfortunatley it ignored more important responsibilities,<br> such as educating young people or taking measures to prevent secondary harm to victims.</p>

<h2 class="h2" style="text-align:center;">Today</h2>
<p class="p3" style="text-align:center;">The acts committed by Japan have left a lasting impact on history and are a very important lesson. <br>They affected millions of people from the Asian countries they invaded, to the western POWs kept in captivity.<br> In my humble opinion the way the Japanese government glosses over its actions is an indicator<br> that it doesn't seem to fully accept the consequences of its actions.</p>


<p class="p4" style="text-align:center;">All things considered I believe that civilians pay for the mistakes of their leaders and those<br> mistakes could cost them their lives. What we should all take away from this however is <br>that ultimatley it is impossible to tell what humanity is capable of when forced to play with<br> cards at hand.</p>
